TODOS:
# hashlistsys, hashsys, and listsys all use directory as an input. Try to
# remove the directory parameter and use only the id_current_directory to
# process tree.

# We have all 3 algos using inorder. Now the hard part is preorder and 
# postfix traversals. Implementations of these two traversals in all 3
# algos will determine the effeciency and usability the data structures.
